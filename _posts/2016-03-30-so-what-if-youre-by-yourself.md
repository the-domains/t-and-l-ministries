This book is a true life story of a young lady whose life experiences caused her great pain and suffering. As men and women, the devil will have us to believe that in the midst of our storms, we are all alone and have no one to talk to or trust. The young lady soon learns that the Lord can turn her life around and use her despite her weaknesses. "What the devil intends for evil, God works it to our good." This is a true example of what it means when your misery becomes your ministry. 

**In this book you will learn:**

* _**Not to curse your crisis**_
* _**Trust God even when you can't trace Him**_
* _**Grow from bitter to better**_
* _**Your set back is a set up for your come back**_
* _**Afflictions will pass over, don't give up!**_

I truly believe that this book will bless you because there were times when I felt like giving up on life, it seemed as though the more I tried and prayed the more things seemed to get worse BUT GOD stepped in the mist of my storms and reassured me that He was right there with me the entire time. When I hit rock bottom I soon discovered that God was the rock at the bottom. Most times God will allow you to go through storms not to hurt you but rather to strengthen you and build character in you so that you can be a living testimony for others along the way. If God can do it for me, I know He can certainly do it you.
